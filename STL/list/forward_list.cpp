/*
forward list :- 1. Forward list in STL implements singly linked list.
                2. The forward list keeps track of the location of only the next element while the list keeps track of both the next and previous elements,
                3. the disadvantage of a forward list is that it cannot be iterated backward and its indivisual elements cannot be accessed directly.
                4. forward list is prefered over the list when only forward traversal is required as we can save space..
